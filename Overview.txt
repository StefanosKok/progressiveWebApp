Emphasize before getting started:

The project assumes basic knowledge of node.js, as 
I'll include a simple Web Socket server to make the 
app real time. I will also specifically not be using
any fully featured frameworks other than the basic user
interface libraries JQuery & Bootstrap, as my main focus 
is on understanding the foundational design of a PWA.
As we've already covered how to create a service worker, 
I'll focus on using Google's Workbox to speed up and simplify 
the process, rather than focusing on what the best service 
worker strategies will be. I'll also use a npm's alternative 
called Yarn.
